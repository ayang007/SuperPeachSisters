# SuperPeachSisters
Project 3 CS 32

This was a project in Object-Oriented programming organization in Introduction to Computer Science II. The graphics 
of the game were already handled by a simple graphics machine, and we were to build the objects and interactions 
between the sprites. There was little sample code given to us, and we were allowed absolute freedom in which 
variables, functions, and inheritance structures we'd like to use. My game was tested on ten points of functionality 
and scored full points. There were powerups, flags, obstacles, and enemies as well as the main sprite character, Peach.

#How to run

Simply compile the .cpp file into an executable and run.
